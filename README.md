App Description:
Todoey is an app for notes.
in the main screen at the navigation bar there is an add button that allows the user att a subject.
the subject get a color regenerated randomly by pod framework for its background in the cell.
tapping on any subject leading you to its page where the user can add things that related to this subject by another add button on the navigation bar.

the list of each subject get its own color, the color that generated for the subject, and any item the user adds to te list make the list like a gradient of its color, all that thanks to the ChameleonFramework pod.

there is also a search bar in the subject page allows the user search for something that contains the search words typed, sorted by data of creation.

to delete an item/ subject the user can swipe to the left side of the screen little to show the deleting button, and if sliding alittle farther left it will delete the item/ subject. this funtionality added using the SwipeCellKit pod.

all cells in the project generated by the same Cell Identifier, i used a reusable cell for the subject and the items lists.
